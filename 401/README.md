# Reverse an Array
To reverse the array, we iterate over the array and swap the elements until we reach the midpoint.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
We talked as a group the best way approach the problem. Then we took turns on the whiteboard writing out a different part of the whiteboarding steps.
